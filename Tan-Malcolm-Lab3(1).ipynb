    "# ## Problem 1: Caesar Cipher (11 points) \n",
    "# \n",
    "# A _cipher_ is a way of disguising a message by encoding it.  \n",
    "# \n",
    "# One of the simplest ciphers is a \"shift cipher\" known as the _Caesar cipher_. The way it works is very simple.  \n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. Start with a message, such as \"ATTACK AT DAWN\".\n",
    "# 2. Choose a number, such as 3.\n",
    "# 3. _Shift_ all letters in the message to the right by the chosen number. In this case, shifting all letters in \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" by 3 results in the message \"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\".\n",
    "# \n",
    "# **Write a function called `problem_1` that takes two positional arguments `message` and `shift`. It should apply the Caesar cipher to a message and _return_ the result.**  \n",
    "# \n",
    "# Example input/output:  \n",
    "# `problem_1(\"ATTACK AT DAWN\", 3)` => `\"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\"`  \n",
    "# `problem_1(\"MEAMORE\", 42)` => `\"CUQCEHU\"`\n",
    "# \n",
    "# For full credit:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. The function must ignore spaces.\n",
    "# 2. The function must be able to \"wrap around\" if it reaches the end of the alphabet. (e.g., shifting Z by 1 should result in A, shifting Z by 2 should result in B, etc.)\n",
    "# \n",
    "# For your convenience:\n",
    "# 1. Assume that all letters will be uppercase.\n",
    "# 2. Be aware of the `chr()` function. `chr()` takes an Unicode code number and returns the character associated with that number (e.g., chr(65) => \"A\").\n",
    "# 3. Be aware of the `ord()` function. `ord()` takes a Unicode character and returns the Unicode code associated with that character (e.g., ord(\"A\") => 65).\n",
    "# 4. Be aware that the Unicode codes of the uppercase English alphabet are Unicode codes 65 to 90, where 65 = A, 66 = B, ..., 90 = Z.\n",
